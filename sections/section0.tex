\section{Introduction \label{sec:intro}}
\subsection{Course Name}

This is a course on combinatorial commutative algebras, however there is a strong relationship between commutative algebras and algebraic geometry -- an equally apt name for this course would be combinatorial algebraic geometry.

\begin{example}
There is a correspondence between the algebraic geometric object of the circle $S^1$ and the commutative algebraic object of the equation $x^2 + y^2 - 1 =0$.
\end{example}

This course will be following three books broadly. In order of difficulty they are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cox-Little-O'Shea
    \item Ener-Herzog
    \item Miller-Sturmfels
\end{itemize}


Note that these notes are meant to provide brief results and not maximal detail.
% There are many famous theorems in Mathematics. One of the most famous theorems is Fermat's Last Theorem.

% \begin{thm}[Fermat's Last Theorem] \label{thm:fermat}
% If $n>2$, there are no integers $a,b,c$ with $abc \neq 0$ such that $a^n + b^n= c^n$.
% \end{thm}


% % Traditional Mathematics
% \subsection{Purpose}

% Theorem~\ref{thm:fermat} is one of the most famous theorems in Mathematics. But most undergraduate students do not learn Fermat's Last Theorem. Instead, many students learn formulas such as:
% 	\[
% 	\oint_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \iint_S \nabla \times \mathbf{F} \cdot dS
% 	\]
% But Mathematics starts far more simple than that. The first topic in Mathematics that one typically sees is Arithmetic. For instance, students typically will learn ``FOIL.'' 
% 	\begin{equation} \label{eq:foil}
% 	(x + y)^2= x^2 + 2xy + y^2
% 	\end{equation}
% However, \eqref{eq:foil} tends to be a stumbling block for students. Many students will instead claim, incorrectly, that $(x+y)^2= x^2 + y^2$. The purpose of this course will be to prove Dirichlet's Unit Theorem, which states:

% \begin{restatable*}[Dirichlet's Unit Theorem]{thm}{unit} \label{thm:unit}
% Let $K$ be a number field of degree $n$ with $r$ real embeddings and $s$ conjugate pairs of complex embeddings. Then the abelian group $\O_K^\times$ is a finitely generated abelian group with rank $r+s-1$ and $\O_K^\times \cong \mu_K \times \Z^{r+s-1}$, where $\mu_K$ are the roots of unity in $\O_K$. 
% \end{restatable*}


% However, it will take some time to prove Theorem~\ref{thm:unit}.
