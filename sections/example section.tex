Recall that the goal of this course was to prove Dirichlet's Unit Theorem:

\unit	% Dirichlet's Unit Theorem

\pf L.T.R. \qed


\begin{ex}
If $K=\Q$, then $r=1$ and $s=0$ so that $r+s-1=0$. Therefore, $\O_\Q^\times=\Z^\times=\{\pm1\}$. Of course, this is the most trivial possible example. \xqed
\end{ex}
